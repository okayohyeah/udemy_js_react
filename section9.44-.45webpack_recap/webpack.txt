Webpack:
  - Latest build tools  
    - bundles tasks
    - doesn't focus on automating tasks
  - Main Webpack Concepts;
    1. Entry
      - first file that kicks off the app
    2. Output
      - tells where code should go and how to treat the bundled code
    3. Loaders 
      - how to process non-JavaScript modules (aka files) and include these dependencies into your bundles
    4. Plugins
      - can do whatever loaders cannot do
      - perform actions and custom functionality on chunks of our bundled modules, incredibly customizable
